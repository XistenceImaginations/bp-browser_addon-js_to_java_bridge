# Information

> This is an example project/boilerplate for creating a browser extension which communicates with a local app server.<br>
  The browser extension is based on JavaScript while the app server uses Java.

## Installation

  - For the browser extension you won't need anything special as the extension
  can be loaded as 'unpacked extension' via its folder while activating the
  'developer mode' for extensions.

  - For the Java-part you'll need a Java-development setup, anything up from Java 8
  and a IDE of your choice should be ok.
